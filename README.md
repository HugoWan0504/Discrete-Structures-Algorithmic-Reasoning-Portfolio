# Discrete Structures & Algorithmic Reasoning Portfolio

## Overview

This repository presents a curated portfolio of **mathematically rigorous analyses and algorithmic implementations** focused on discrete structures and theoretical foundations of computer science. The work emphasizes **formal proof techniques, asymptotic reasoning, and structural analysis**, demonstrating how abstract mathematics underpins practical algorithms and system behavior.

All components are presented as **self-contained technical artifacts**, suitable for academic, research, or software engineering review.
